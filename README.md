# sunsetstarter
 a discord bot


Before you start you will need to do a couple of things. First off you will need to go in and create a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications. After making the bot replace "Your discord token" with your bot token.

Second off you will need to install python on your computer and install discord. As well as those, you'll need to install pretty-help.

Third off, you will need to go into main.py and replace the author id with your user id. As if you don't, you will not be able to go in and use the developer commands.

# Import these

"pip3 install discord" or "pip install discord"
"pip3 install discord-pretty-help" or "pip install discord-pretty-help"
